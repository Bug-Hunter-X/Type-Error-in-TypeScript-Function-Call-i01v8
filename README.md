# Type Error in TypeScript Function Call

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when calling a function with arguments of incorrect types.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but it's called with a string and a number, leading to a type error.

The solution involves ensuring that the types of the function arguments match the types of the values passed to the function.  This might involve type checking or type assertion, depending on your specific needs.
